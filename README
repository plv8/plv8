A Procedural Language in JavaScript powered by V8
=================================================

plv8 is a shared library that provides a PostgreSQL procedural language powered
by V8 JavaScript Engine.  With this program you can write in JavaScript your
function that is callable from SQL.

REQUIREMENT
-----------

plv8 is tested with:

- PG: version 8.4, 9.0, 9.1, 9.2 and 9.3dev (maybe older are allowed)
- V8: version 3.14.5
- g++: version 4.5.1

Also all tools that PostgreSQL and V8 require to be built are required.

INSTALL
-------

There are two ways to build plv8.  The first is default `make`, which depends
on system-installed libv8 and plv8 will be dynamically link to it.  The second
is `make static`, which will download v8 soure at a specific version and build
it, and statically link plv8 to it.  PGXN install will use the former, while
you can do the latter manually if you have not installed v8 yet.

Once you installed plv8 into your dabase, create language via

  $ psql -c 'CREATE EXTENSION plv8'
  $ psql -c 'CREATE EXTENSION plls'
  $ psql -c 'CREATE EXTENSION plcoffee'

in 9.1 or later, or in the prior versions

  $ psql -f plv8.sql

to create database objects.

In mingw64, you may have difficulty in building plv8.  If so, try to make
the following changes in Makefile.

  CUSTOM_CC = gcc
  SHLIB_LINK := $(SHLIB_LINK) -lv8 -Wl,-Bstatic -lstdc++ -Wl,-Bdynamic -lm

TEST
----

plv8 supports installcheck test.  Make sure set custom_variable_classes = 'plv8'
in your postgresql.conf (before 9.2) and run

  $ make installcheck

EXAMPLE (JAVASCRIPT)
--------------------

  CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION plv8_test(keys text[], vals text[])
  RETURNS text AS $$
    var o = {};
    for(var i=0; i<keys.length; i++){
      o[keys[i]] = vals[i];
    }
    return JSON.stringify(o);
  $$ LANGUAGE plv8 IMMUTABLE STRICT;
  
  SELECT plv8_test(ARRAY['name', 'age'], ARRAY['Tom', '29']);
           plv8_test        
  ---------------------------
   {"name":"Tom","age":"29"}
  (1 row)

EXAMPLE (COFFEESCRIPT)
----------------------

  CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION plcoffee_test(keys text[], vals text[])
  RETURNS text AS $$
    return JSON.stringify(keys.reduce(((o, key, idx) ->
      o[key] = vals[idx]; return o), {}), {})
  $$ LANGUAGE plcoffee IMMUTABLE STRICT;
  
  SELECT plcoffee_test(ARRAY['name', 'age'], ARRAY['Tom', '29']);
         plcoffee_test       
  ---------------------------
   {"name":"Tom","age":"29"}
  (1 row)

EXAMPLE (LIVESCRIPT)
--------------------

  CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION plls_test(keys text[], vals text[])
  RETURNS text AS $$
    return JSON.stringify { [key, vals[idx]] for key, idx in keys }
  $$ LANGUAGE plls IMMUTABLE STRICT;
  
  SELECT plls_test(ARRAY['name', 'age'], ARRAY['Tom', '29']);
           plls_test        
  ---------------------------
   {"name":"Tom","age":"29"}
  (1 row)
